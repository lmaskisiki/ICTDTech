''The Canadian government has asked us to get them out of Canada as soon as possible,? said Johan Heine, chairperson of the board of Working on Fire.

But Heine said the team has indicated that they will not leave until they receive confirmation that their pay demands will be met.

''They are demanding their money before they leave, and [that they] get confirmation that they get more money.''

''We all feel very terrible about it,'' said Heine, who has been a firefighter for 30 years.

A Working on Fire management team arrived in Edmonton, Canada on Saturday morning and would travel with a South African embassy official to Alberta where they are based, to negotiate and pick a date for their return.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported online that Premier of Alberta, Rachel Notley promised to intervene.</li></ul><ul><li class="feedtitle"><a href="./Insert title here_files/Insert title here.html">New treatment for liver cancer comes online</a></li><li class="feedbody">Today is National Cancer Survivors Day and what better way to celebrate with survivors of this deadly disease than by highlighting a new avenue of treatment that will bring hope to many liver cancer patients.

Called SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres, these microscopic resin beads contain the radioactive isotope Yttrium-90 (Y-90) and emit radiation to kill cancer cells.

Due to their small size (1/3 the width of a human hair), they travel easily with the bloodstream directly to the liver tumours. The microspheres become lodged inside the microvasculature that supplies the tumour and kills the cancer cells through radiation.

Discovery Health has been given the green light to cover this treatment under its medical aid scheme, which will bring hope to many liver cancer patients in the country who would otherwise not have had access to treatment</li></ul><ul><li class="feedtitle"><a href="./Insert title here_files/Insert title here.html">Everyone is feeling the pinch, but a deal that sounds too good to be true must be avoided at all costs, writes Mike McDougall</a></li><li class="feedbody">Faced with empty wallets and an increased cost of living, thousands of South Africans are placing their faith in get-rich-quick schemes, which lure desperate consumers with promises of unrealistic investment returns.

But whether it?s a Ponzi or a pyramid scheme, it can be mathematically proven that such schemes will eventually collapse and leave investors with nothing.

Ponzi and pyramid schemes are in essence the same thing ? both rely on contributions from new investors to pay existing investors the promised returns. These are usually totally unrealistic and not comparable to returns achieved by legitimate savings and investment products.

While investors in a pyramid scheme know that they need to recruit new members to maintain the flow of funds, Ponzi schemes claim to make legitimate investments, but instead use the funds to enrich founders rather than use them for any legitimate business purposes.
It can be stated with absolute certainty that these schemes will eventually collapse, leaving many people financially destitute, while only the founders and a few early participants make considerable gains.
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, if a scheme is paying out more than is being earned, it will run out of money.
Secondly, such schemes constantly need new members to join in to sustain payments to existing members, and the reality is that they will ultimately run out of new investors.</li></ul></div></div>
